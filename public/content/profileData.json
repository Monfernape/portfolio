    "about": "A mechanical engineer whose engine pumps JavaScript now. Iâ€™m a community-taught developer with over 6 years of experience and no longer fear breaking the web. As an engineer, I take challenges heads on and love solving complex problems.\n\nI've been building SaaS all my career. Being at SaaS requires one to be very vigilant and have a mindset of unblocking themselves and be the first one to fire a solution. Ariglad is a fine example in my career, and we were only two developers in the team. We'd kept our planning really solid and didn't hesitate to go on wild routes while implementing stuff. New SaaS startups have a bit of pressurised settings, but I enjoy it generally as it gives me more freedom to experiment things.\n\nOn frontend, Next.js is my go-to framework while I've a great working experience with Angular as well. New features such as React Server Components and transition APIs excites me the most. Similarly, on the backend, I'm well versed with both Express and NestJS. MongoDB is my favourite DB, and I do adore Postgres sometimes.\n\nI've been actively working on codebases that heavily rely on TypeScript. I'm very comfortable with generics, union types, discrimination types and other utilities. Something that comes to mind is one NPM library I built for my previous role which had a lot of TypeScript magic.\n\nI'm used to keeping things very planned actually. I've a habit of writing something called Technical Design Document (TDD) that covers up the ideation of my development workflow, potential blockers and alternative routes. I'd then set up a team calendar invite to go through the TDD and put things into discussion. We'd outline several points and have them answer right on spot thanks to the product team around. We'd then move on creating T-shirt sizes tickets and milestones accordingly.\n\nI'm enthusiastic about the prospect of joining your team and being part of something awesome.",
